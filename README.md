# ReadMe Generator

## Description
This is a ReadMe generator to simplify and reduce the time spent on creating ReadMe files for programming projects. The application can be accessed through Node in the user's terminal. Once initiated, the program prompts the user to answer several questions. The user's answers are then generated into a template Readme that is saved as a markdown file in the project folder.
